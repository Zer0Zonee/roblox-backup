I made this in like roughly 3 hours, backs up all scripts (including modules) and their children, you can edit this if you want because I'll probably never use this knowing Roblox has automatic backups anyways.

Doesn't save all folders and doesnt save guis, but saves all scripts in a folder in ServerStorage with the date and time (in PST, so you can change it) set as the name. Parents all scripts to their respective services.

Shouldn't need any configuration, creates a new folder if it doesnt find the directory named "BackupScripts".
